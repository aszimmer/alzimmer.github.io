## Sentiment Analysis on Employee Reviews

**Project description:** sentiment analysis using VADER conducted in Python that evaluated collected employee review data

### Problem Statement
Sentiment analysis helps the business monitor team and individual performance and sentiment through feedback and reviews. Natural language processing helps organizations sift through large amounts of unstructured text data efficeintly and at scales. Tagging text by sentiment is also highly subjective and unique to the individual doing the review. By introducing machine learning, accuracy and standardization across the organization is possible.

### Results and Implications

The resulting accuracy score from VADER did not outperform random guessing, but future work can be done to improve the defined polarity score used in this analysis. The project code shows a marked improvement of 21% between the first testing and the second testing, so quality improvement is possible in the future. 

### Limitations
THe data required to perform this type of modeling is highly sensitive in nature and not usually shared outside of human resource professionals and direct leadreship of an employee. The dataset used was collected in partnership with Amazon MTurk workers. There are always limits to how well fabricated data can portray real people and actions.
